            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Our cross country and track & field programs have a brand new digital home, thanks to cross country team member Nolan Erpelding,
                    who wanted to give something back to a program that has given him so much. As a runner on the Minnetonka cross
                    country team, Nolan found himself constantly frustrated with the old website—trying to check meet times on his phone
                    meant endless zooming and scrolling. Instead of just complaining about it, he decided to fix it himself.</p>
                
                <p>Nolan poured his own personal time into building the new website from scratch, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along the way. 
                    He took the time to fine tune every detail, from the color scheme that reflects Minnetonka's colors to the hamburger menu on mobile
                    that helps make the site work well on any device.</p>
                <p>We are incredibly grateful for Nolan's dedication and hard work in creating this new website. It's a testament to the spirit of 
                    our team, we hope this website serves as a valuable resource for all our athletes, parents, and fans.</p>

                <p>Sadly, our boys cross country assistant coach for the past ten years, Steve Hoag passed away at home
                    on September 15, 2017 at the age of 70. He had been recovering over the past year from double lung
                    transplant surgery, and had developed pneumonia in late June of this year. His enthusiasm for
                    working with young runners was truly amazing. He touched all those who were privileged to get to
                    know him over the years.</p>

                <p>He was a Minnesota running legend, having been Gopher All American distance runner and Big Ten 2 mile
                    champ in his college days, and national caliber road runner in the 1970's. He placed 2nd in the 1975
                    Boston Marathon (behind Bill Rodgers) in 2:11.39, and was ranked #4 in the world that year.</p>

                <p>He owned and operated Marathon Sports running store in south Minneapolis for twenty plus years,
                    before retiring to help coach at Richfield then Minnetonka. Tonka was so fortunate to have him
                    coaching here over the years, and he will be greatly missed. He will be honored at the Griak
                    Invitation at the University of Minnesota in a moment of silence just before the Division 1 college
                    and High School Gold races.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">Former Head Track Coach, Joe Lane, Passed Away</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>We are so sad to write that Joe Lane passed away on Wednesday, June 28, 2017. Joe coached boys' track and field at
                    Minnetonka from 1971-2000. He was an assistant with Bob Rogness from 1971-72, and became the boys' head coach in 1973.
                    His teams were legendary, finishing in the top 10 at State numerous times, and winning the State title in 1976.</p>
                <p>"Joe coached and taught at Minnetonka both in the middle schools and at the high school levels. He touched countless
                    lives in so many ways. He had a passion for kids and coaching that was apparent from the moment you met him! His
                    knowledge was surpassed only by the kindness of his heart. Joe also had a stubborn streak that made you know he meant
                    business!!!! All of these attributes combined to make Joe the wonderful person he was.</p>
                <p>On a personal note, I was blessed to meet Joe in 1985, my first year coaching at Minnetonka. He was a wonderful friend,
                    a great mentor, and a caring human being. We were blessed with a great staff, and my days working with Joe and Bob
                    Rogness are some of my favorite memories. As track and field athletes, we all know that it is not only about all the
                    meters we run, or the throws, or the jumps that we do. The relationships that we make are truly some of the greatest
                    memories that we will take with us. As I contacted former athletes to let them know of Joe's passing, one thing was
                    clear-the huge impact that he had made on their lives. Many people commented "He always believed in me." "He is the one
                    who pushed me". "Joe helped me believe in myself". "He had a huge impact on my life". THIS is Joe's legacy. The world is
                    better for having had him and we are better people for having known him. Thank you, Joe. Jane Reimer-Morgan"</p>
